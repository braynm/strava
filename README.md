# Strava

Elixir wrapper for the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/) (V3).

Client was generated from the [Strava API Swagger definition](https://developers.strava.com/docs/#client-code) using the [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

All calls to the Strava API require an `access_token` defining the athlete and application making the call. Any registered Strava user can obtain an `access_token` by first creating an application at [developers.strava.com](https://developers.strava.com/).

## Installation

  1. Add `strava` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

  ```elixir
  def deps do
    [{:strava, "~> 0.6"}]
  end
  ```

## Usage

Add the following `strava` configuration settings to each environment's mix config file.

Enter your Strava application settings as shown on https://www.strava.com/settings/api.

```elixir
# config/dev.exs
use Mix.Config

config :strava,
  client_id: <client id>,
  client_secret: "<client secret>",
  access_token: "<access token>",
  redirect_uri: "<redirect url>"
```

### Client

All requests to the Strava API require [authentication](https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/).

Create a client to make requests as your own application:

```elixir
client = Strava.Client.new()
```

Provide an athlete's `access_token` to make requests on behalf of an authenticated athlete:

```elixir
client = Strava.Client.new("<<access_token>>")
```

### Clubs

#### Get club by id

```elixir
{:ok, %Strava.DetailedClub{} = club} = Strava.Clubs.get_club_by_id(client, 1)
```

#### Get club members by id

```elixir
{:ok, members} = Strava.Clubs.get_club_members_by_id(client, 1, per_page: 20, page: 1)
```

### Segments

#### Get segment by id

```elixir
{:ok, %Strava.DetailedSegment{}} = Strava.Segments.get_segment_by_id(client, 229781)
```

### Segment efforts

#### Get efforts by segment id

```elixir
{:ok, segment_efforts} = Strava.SegmentEfforts.get_efforts_by_segment_id(client, 229781)
```

Returns segment efforts for the authenticated athlete only.

##### Get efforts by start and end dates

```elixir
{:ok, segment_efforts} = Strava.SegmentEfforts.get_efforts_by_segment_id(client, 229781,
  start_date_local: "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  end_date_local: "2014-01-01T23:59:59Z"
})
```

Convert `DateTime` structs to an ISO 8601 formatted date time string using:

```elixir
DateTime.to_iso8601(start_date_local)
```

#### Get segment effort by id

```elixir
{:ok, %Strava.DetailedSegmentEffort{} = segment_effort} =
  Strava.SegmentEfforts.get_segment_effort_by_id(client, 269990681)
```

### Activities

#### Get activity by id

```elixir
{:ok, %Strava.DetailedActivity{} = activity} = Strava.Activities.get_activity_by_id(client, 746805584)
```

#### Get logged in athlete's activities

```elixir
{:ok, activities] = Strava.Activities.get_logged_in_athlete_activities(client, per_page: 50, page: 1)
```

#### Stream paginated requests

Any requests which take optional pagination params (`per_page` and `page`) can be converted to an Elixir `Stream` by using `Strava.Paginator.stream/2`.

The first argument is a function which is provided the current pagination params to make the request to the Strava API.

```elixir
stream =
  Strava.Paginator.stream(
    fn pagination ->
      Strava.SegmentEfforts.get_efforts_by_segment_id(client, segment_id, pagination)
    end,
    per_page: 10
  )

segment_efforts = stream |> Stream.take(20) |> Enum.to_list()
```

A `Strava.Paginator.RequestError` error will be raised if the request returns an error tagged tuple.

### OAuth support

You can use Strava as an authentication provider with the OAuth2 strategy included in this library.

Use `Strava.Auth.authorize_url!/1` to generate the Strava URL to redirect unauthenticated users to. After the user has successfully authenticated with Strava you can use `Strava.Auth.get_token!` to access their summary details and unique access token required to make authenticated requests on behalf of the user.

An example Phoenix authentication controller is shown below:

```elixir
defmodule Example.AuthController do
  use Example.Web, :controller

  def index(conn, _params) do
    redirect conn, external: Strava.Auth.authorize_url!(scope: "public")
  end

  def delete(conn, _params) do
    conn
    |> configure_session(drop: true)
    |> redirect(to: "/")
  end

  @doc """
  This action is reached via `/auth/callback` and is the the callback URL that
  Strava will redirect the user back to with a `code` that will be used to
  request an access token. The access token will then be used to access
  protected resources on behalf of the user.
  """
  def callback(conn, %{"code" => code}) do
    client = Strava.Auth.get_token!(code: code)
    athlete = Strava.Auth.get_athlete!(client)

    conn
      |> put_session(:current_athlete, athlete)
      |> put_session(:access_token, client.token.access_token)
      |> redirect(to: "/")
  end
end
```

With the `access_token` tracked against the user's session you can make requests to the Strava API on their behalf. Use `Strava.Client.new(access_token)` to create a client to use with each request for that user.

## Testing

To run the entire test suite, create a file called `config/test.secret.exs` with the following:

```elixir
# config/test.secret.exs
use Mix.Config

config :strava,
  access_token: "<access_token>",
  test: [
    athlete_id: "<athlete_id>",
    club_id: "<club_id>",
    segment_id: "<segment_id>"
  ]
```

Replace the above placeholders with values appropriate for your own Strava application and athlete profile: your own athlete id; a club id you are a member of; and a segment you have made at least one attempt at.

To run the test suite:

```
$ mix test
```

## Contributing

Pull requests to contribute new or improved features, and extend documentation are most welcome.

Please follow the existing coding conventions, or refer to the Elixir style guide.

You should include unit tests to cover any changes.
